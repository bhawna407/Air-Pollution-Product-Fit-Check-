🌫️ AIRPURE – India Air Quality, Health & Mobility Impact Analysis
📌 Executive Summary (Must-Read)

This project analyzes air quality (AQI) patterns across India and their impact on public health, vehicle usage, and EV adoption.
The dashboard helps policy makers, environmental agencies, and business teams understand where pollution is highest, who is most affected, and what factors contribute to AQI deterioration.

Key insight:
Poor air quality is concentrated in specific states and cities, strongly correlated with pollutant type, population density, disease incidence, and vehicle mix, creating clear intervention and market opportunities.

❓ Business Question – “So What?”

Which states & cities consistently report poor AQI?

Which pollutants drive air quality degradation?

How does AQI relate to disease cases?

Is there a relationship between vehicle type / EV adoption and AQI?

Which regions offer highest potential for air purifier products?

🧠 Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Air Quality Overview

Average AQI by state & city

AQI status classification (Good → Severe)

State-wise pollutant dominance

Impact: Enables targeted pollution control strategies.

3️⃣ Health Impact Analysis

Disease cases mapped against AQI levels

Disease distribution by age group

State-wise top pollution-linked diseases

Impact: Connects environmental data with public health outcomes.

4️⃣ Geographic Risk Mapping
